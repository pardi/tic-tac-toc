# tic-tac-toc in React
This repo shows a simple implementation of the tic-tac-toc tutorial in [React](https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe)

A board 3x3 is created and the user can interact with the board by clicking on valid squares. When one of the players ('X' or 'O') win, no more inputs are allowed.

A time-travel feature is present, where the user can go-back to a previous state of the game and start the game from there. The previous history of the game is lost when we take a new move.

#Installation

Then run:
```

Run the server:
